NAME
    bzl_cred_helper.pl - Extract credentials from a .netrc.gpg file for a
    given URI

SYNOPSIS
      $ echo '{"uri":"http://example.com"}' | perl bzl_cred_helper.pl get

DESCRIPTION
    This script reads a JSON input from stdin, extracts the URI, finds the
    matching credentials from the decrypted .netrc.gpg file, and outputs
    JSON-formatted headers with Authorization token for Bazel.

    The script assumes that the credentials are stored in the ~/.netrc.gpg
    and that gpg is configured correctly on your host machine (like
    gpg-agent and so on).

USAGE
      bazel build --credential_helper=/path/to/bzl_cred_helper.pl '//pkg:*'
